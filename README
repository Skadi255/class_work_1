For our project, we decided to explore the question, "How did COVID-19 effect the housing market?"

To help us better explore this question, we broke this down into many, smaller questions.  Some of these questions are directly tied to the housing market, others are designed to give us a broader picture of the American worker, their job opportunities, and their finance options at that time, all which affect housing decisions.  The questions we researched were:
    - Did COVID lead to a housing market boom?   
    - How did house sales change from 2018-2019 to 2020-2021?
    - How did interest rates change pre-covid and post-covid?
    - How was house price affected by Covid?  
    - What is the change in square foot price in real estate?
    - How did job opportunities change pre and post Covid?  
    - Were more remote work job opportunities available? 
    - Was housing price affected by supply materials and shipping? 
    
We gathered data from the following sources:
FHFA - https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx
Zillow - http://www.zillow.com/research/data
Yahoo Finance - https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/Z/history?p=Z
Travis County Office - https://www.traviscountytx.gov/open-data-portal
Bureau of Labor Statistics - https://www.bls.gov/data/ 
Social Security Administration - www.socialsecurity.gov

Then we analyzed our data sets and visualized the data.  Our followings are explored and visualized in the following jupyter notebooks:
- UpdatedMainAc.ipynb
- Preeti.ipynb
- main.ipynb
- housing_mat_costs.ipynb

Here are the findings we found:

*The following questions are explored and visualized within the notebook "UpdatedMainAC.ipynb"

** How was house proce affected by COVID?**
    We looked the HPI data over the years and noticed a steep rise in the house prices during the COVID years. The average price increase for Pre Covid years was 16.82 and during/post Covid was 54.59. Clearly the house prices increased drmaticaly oevr these years compared to the previous years. Overall average change in price index was imapcted as well. 

** How did job opportunities change pre and post Covid: Were more work from home oppotunities available?**
    The data we were able to find showed the percentage of people working from home each year.  We narrowed this down to 2 years pre-Covid and 2 years post-covid to really show the difference.  There is a incredibly steep increase in the percentage of people working from home that occurs during 2020.  In 2018, we had about 5% of people that reported working from home.  At the height of the graph, in 2020, we see around 60% of people working from home.  After that hike, numbers decrease sharply, but they stop decreasing when we hit around 30% in 2021.  
    
** How did job opportunities change pre and post Covid: What was the average wage of the American worker? **
    When pulling the data of average wage of the American worker, it was important to pull data from much earlier than in some of our other data sets.  Due to inflation, the average wage does slowly increase over time, and has since 1985.  We see fluctuations in the data, as the average wage bounces up and down.  Where we can really see an effect, however, is when we pull the percent increase in wage from year to year.  Again, this number fluctuates, but we see a sharp increase unlike any other in 2020, right after COVID-19 begins.  We can extrapolate from this that companies had to really work to keep workers at this time, as many people were choosing to leave the workforce.  These higher paying jobs and increase of average wage definitely had an impact on housing choices and the housing market. 

** How did interest rates change pre-covid and post-covid?
    We pulled the historical rates of interest rates in America in order to determine if this could have affected the housing market at that time.  Which the graph does show many changes, in particular a increase in interest rates from 2018-2019, followed by a decrease starting in late 2018 that continues till 2021, this change doesn't correlate to COVID-19 times.  From this graph, we can conclude that the interest rates were affected by factors other than the COVID-19 pandemic.  While interest rates would still affect housing choices, they themselves are not affected by the pandemic directly. 


*In the main.ipynb, the way houses were being baught was explored. This is insite into weather there was a boom pre or post covid. 

Housing Cost section
** The data set looks at the percentage of homes by state sold above the listing price. This is an indication of muliple buyer wanting the same
   home and the highist bidder getting the purchase. 

** A drastic change in houses selling above listing price indicates there arent enough homes for sale that meet the demand for the people who are ready to buy.	  

** The data set also explores if this change is consistent with the given time frame of the covid out break.

Was the price of building a home affected by COVID?

From the data I have gathered, the price of building materials saw a drastic increase while prices of homes also increased. 

From the graph labeled “percentage change in materials and components”
You can further see the breakdown of different building materials. The group with the highest percentage change was the plumbing and flooring.
